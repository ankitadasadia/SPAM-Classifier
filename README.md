Introduction
Natural language processing (NLP) is about developing applications and services that are able to understand human languages. Some Practical examples of NLP are speech recognition for eg: google voice search, understanding what the content is about or sentiment analysis etc.

NLP Implementations
These are some of the successful implementations of Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc. Google search engine understands that you are a tech guy so it shows you results related to you.

Social websites feed like the Facebook news feed. The news feed algorithm understands your interests using natural language processing and shows you related Ads and posts more likely than other posts.

Speech engines like Apple Siri.

Spam filters like Google spam filters. It’s not just about the usual spam filtering, now spam filters understand what’s inside the email content and see if it’s a spam or not.
